          <h2>Me</h2>
          <p>
              I'm a teenager who started learning to code in 2016, still going strong! I know javascript, html, node (if that even counts as a language), and css well. I love coding games so this site is mostly a hub for my games.
          </p>
          <h2>My Games</h2>
          <p>
              Some of my past games you will find were made with scratch and Khan academy's pjs language. At the moment, I am using p5, a javascript library that makes interactivity and controlling the canvas way easier. Very soon, I will beginning learning unity. Unity is a great game engine that I can create some amazing stuff with.
          </p>
          <h2>This Site</h2>
          <p>
              This site was made using a domain from freenom, and was put on the internet using netlify. I used free libraries bootstrap, jquery, and popper to make this site.
          </p>
