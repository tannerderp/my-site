      <h2>Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a programmer who started on <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/tannerderp/">scratch</a>
      and then went to <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/tannerderp">Khan Academy</a>.
      But I've recently gotten into web development and I've made a website. I'm currently working on p5
      games, khan academy games, and a little bit of scratch. But in the future I'm going to start using unity.</p>
      <h2>Notable Things I've done</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Made a successful and memey game on scratch, <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/239890141/" target  = "_blank">Flex Tape Adventure</a>
        <li>Made a successful and cool game on khan, <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/basketball/5289777235394560">Basketball</a>
        <li>Somehow was able to put up this website thanks to the help of <a href = "https://www.paradox42.tk" target = "_blank">Paradox Programming</a>
